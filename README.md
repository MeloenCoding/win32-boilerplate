# win32-example
A boilerplate project for the win32 crate. Fully documented with good references and usefull links.

## Usefull documentation i've used
- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqCJpWy5Fohd3S7ICFXwUomYW0Wv67pDD (*)
  - Used it to see what steps to take and how basic win32 principles work
- https://wiki.winehq.org/List_Of_Windows_Messages 
  - A list of all the window messages

## Why

I'm uploading this because there are way to few projects that use and explain this api. Msdn sucks (sorry microsoft but it's a mess), no 
videos about it whatsoever along with the examples from the creators themselves are garbage and don't explain anything. Therefore i am 
uploading this project. Every time i learn new things about this crate i'll upload it and try to explain what i learned and what i think 
it does. 

If i am incorrect about something, please tell me.
